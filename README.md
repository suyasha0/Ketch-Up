For our midterm project, we are planning to create a platform game that automatically scrolls on movement, and as the character, you have to move and avoid obstacles using your voice. Low or quiet sounds will register as walking, while a louder or higher pitch will register as a jump. The longer you hold the sound, the higher or farther the jump will be. To make the game more challenging, every ten or so platforms will introduce a new enemy or obstacle. We can add coins for extra points or perhaps incorporate lives and moving enemies that use Perlin noise to move until you’re a certain distance, at which point they zoom after you. Character images can also change based on what happens, for example, we can have power ups. If we have extra time, we might create additional game modes, for example, a version that allows you to use WASD controls, or hard version where the screen automatically scrolls even if you don’t move.

The inspiration for this project was that we thought it would be fun to play with the sound library. Also, we saw a video of a similar game being played and it was really funny. We wanted to recreate that game with our own theme. For now, we are considering a tomato theme.
