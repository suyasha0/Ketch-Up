# Ketch Up

A platform game that automatically scrolls right, and as the character, you have to move and avoid obstacles using your voice. Low or quiet sounds will register as walking, while a louder or higher pitch will register as a jump. The longer you hold the sound, the higher or farther the jump will be.
